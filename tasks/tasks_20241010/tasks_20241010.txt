[Task]
04.55.[0.02] Design today's workflow

   [Subtask]
   04.57.[0.05] Check for mew requirements by Berrilan in received emails
      [Success]
      05.10.[0.27] Checked new requirements and also replied to Walter's support email

   [Subtask]
   05.12.[0.3] Design suppliers unrepeated inverse data transfer workflow
      [Ongoing]
      05.17.[0.38] Setting current subtask as task

[Task]
05.17.[0.38] Design suppliers unrepeated inverse data transfer workflow

   [Subtask]
   05.28.[0.57] Delete suppliers previously transfered from Gestproject to Sage
      [Success]
      05.31.[0.62] Done

   [Subtask]
   05.36.[0.7] Use current synchronize suppliers (that only executes simple data transfer) to transfer the current gestproject suppliers to Sage, in order to delete them from Gestproject, to start designing in thought and code, the inverse synchronization process. Remember to duplicate the current supplier processes folder to avoid valuable data loss
      [Success]
      05.42.[0.8] Done. Remember that the current supplier workflow seem to be trying to duplicate entites (I don't know yet if it's due to tweaks in yesterday's meeting with Sage technichal support)

   [Subtask]
   05.43.[0.82] Delete all suppliers from Gestproject
[Stop]
06.02.[1.13] Prepare Elías for school, and didn't finished because after deleting the PAR_TPA '12' value registries, and trying to delete the corresponding participants in both the UI and database, found out that both interfaces are referenced to other tables, and therefore prevent deletion until the referenced items are also deleted

   [Subtask]
   07.32.[0] Write to José Luis to request support to clean up my current Gestproject data to test the reverse data transfer process
      [Success]
      07.48.[0.27] Done but José Luis is not responding quikly, therefore I'll refactor the part of the code that's throwing an error after deleting the '12' values registries in the PAR_TPA table. While waiting, I made some research on classes design.

   [Subtask]
   07.50.[0.3] Find the issue spot where the application breaks when trying to load the participants
      07.57.[0.4] The issue is at GestprojectProvidersManager
      07.59.[0.45] José Luis responded, therefore I'll talk with him about the previous task alongside the current task
      [Success]
      08.13.[0.68] The issue was the absense of a check before processing the 'gestprojectProviderParticipantList'. I added a check that prevents the processing of this list (the processing done of convert it's participants models to Providers models) when the 'gestprojectProviderParticipantList' is empty
[Ongoing]
08.18.[0.77] I decided to break up this task to ease it's manageability

-----------------------------
[Task]
08.20.[0.8] Duplicate the provider syncronization directory to avoid valuable data loss

   [Subtask]
   08.35.[1.05] Duplicate folder, move it to the '__prev' folder, rename every file namespace, and coment a code block in two files, to allow for compilation
      08.37.[1.08] Failed to build and to detect errors in visual studio
      08.41.[1.15] I deleted the folder and tried to run the application whit a single providers synchronization folter but the compiler said that the process is already running
      08.43.[1.18] Because no SincronizadorGPS50.exe was found in the task manager, I closed and opened visual studio to check if the error goes away
      08.45.[1.22] It worked now. It was a bug in Visual Studio.
      08.45.[1.22] I'll push to github before continuing to avoid valuable data loss
      08.48.[1.27] Done. I verified at Github's website
   [Failure]
   08.52.[1.33] Instead of duplicating the providers synchronization directory, I'll duplicate the files and try to move them to the _prev directory of the provider synchronization directory
      08.55.[1.38] I'll proceed to declare this task as failed also, to begin the providers inverse synchroniztion process without the folder duplication action, but using file duplication (the previous files will be move to the inmediate _prev directory after validating that the new ones run smoothly) approach
[Failure]
08.59.[1.45] I'll try a different approach. the reason were explained in the item above.

-----------------------------
[Task]
09.02.[1.5] Evaluate if the 'ProvidersDataTableManager' class is refactorable to allow the inverse provider synchronization workflow
[Stop]
09.03.[1.52] My head hurts beacuse of the eyeglasses and it's time for a leg stretch
[Success]
09.41.[0] Because I can load the Sage entities and convert them into Gestproject entities, and add the alongside the Gestproject providers list, I can efectively incorporate the reverse synchronization process

-----------------------------
[Task]
09.46.[0.08] Refactor 'ProvidersDataTableManager.GetAndStoreGestprojectEntities()' to incorporate the Sage Entities to the 'GestprojectEntities' list
      10.04.[0.38] All of this time I tried to delete Gestproject table elements to release the constraints of the suppliers in order to delete them but found it impossible, everithing seems to be interconnected. I deleted all the records in nearly 20 tables and still won't be allowed to delete the providers

   [Subtask]
   10.06.[0.42] Validate that the 'new GestprojectProvidersManager().GetAll(gestprojectConnectionManager.GestprojectSqlConnection);' statement retrieves an empty list.
      [Success]
      10.09.[0.47] Validated

   [Subtask]
   10.10.[0.48] Generate a method that returns a list of Sage50ProviderModel
      [Success]
      10.21.[0.67] Done and validated

   [Subtask]
   10.22.[0.68] Generate a method that generates and returns a list of GestprojectProviderModel from a Sage50ProviderModel list
      [Success]
      10.34.[0.88] Done, validated and also validated the adding of the two lists to obtain the final Gestproject entity list

   [Subtask]
   10.40.[0.98] REfactor the proccess gestproject entitiy method to inforce that the sage guid and code get's printed along with the rest of the entity data translated to the new Gestproject entity
[Stop]
10.40.[0.98] My head hurts beacuse of the eyeglasses and it's time for a leg stretch
      11.01.[0] Validate if the data is duplicated on table recreation
      11.45.[0.73] Identified that actually, only the first record is being registered, and went through to refactor the append synchronization data to entity method, but it's correctness hasn't been validated
      [Subtask]
      11.47.[0.77] Evaluate the 'DetermineEntityWorkflow' method to determine unregistering entities issue spots
         11.50.[0.82] Evaluate the 'DetermineEntityWorkflow.WasEntityRegistered' method which is the first filtering step
[Stop]
11.50.[0.82] Went to look for Elías
         13.10.[0] Evaluate the 'DetermineEntityWorkflow.WasEntityRegistered' method which is the first filtering step
[Stop]
13.23.[0.22] Issue at environment
         13.38.[0] Evaluate the 'DetermineEntityWorkflow.WasEntityRegistered' method which is the first filtering step
         [Success]
         14.23.[0.75] Corrected Method

   [Subtask]
   14.23.[0.75] Refactor Register entity method
      [Success]
      14.40.[1.03] Refactored Successfully
[Stop]
14.40.[1.03] Lunch Time

   [Subtask]
   17.10.[0] Analyze and respond to Enrique's question carefully
      [Success]
      17.49.[0.65] Responded to Enrique's messages until he told me that he'll leave the task for tomorrow due to other pending tasks

   [Subtask]
   18.20.[1.17] Refactor 'UpdateEntity' method that's producing duplication
[Stop]
18.32.[1.37] Ended work day. Last task is pending
